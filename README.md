# ILBE-Assault-Pack-Rewrite-GERRNG-Edit

This mod is a rewrite of the ILBE Assault Pack (TFAR) mod made by Raspu, rewriten by Grezvany13 and modified by me :3

## Why does this exist when the original exists?
* It started with a innocent question and ended with Grezvany13 kicking people from their discord for daring to question their interpretation of the [Arma Public License - Share Alike](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)
* The Author of the rewrite, Grezvany13, thinks that they can rightfully launch DMCA Claims against people who modify the code they published under the [APL-SA](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike).
* This behavior goes directly against the clauses stated in the [APL-SA](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike) itself, that mainly being:
  *  Section 2(a)(1)(a) and (b): Which states that, Subject to the terms and conditions of the Public License, the Licensor grants worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial and ArmaOnly purposes only and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial and ArmaOnly purposes only.
  *  Section 3(b)(3): Which states that no additional Terms can be imposed onto the material licensed under the [APL-SA](https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike).
